### Objective 
The main objective of this class is to train students in basic concepts and techniques related to data analysis and understanding with application to biomechanics. 

### Course Outcomes
Students, upon completing this course, should be able to:
1. Use the Python programming language to solve basic programming challenges
2. Read and visualize biomechanics data using the Python programming language 
3. Understand and use data science algorithms for inferring relationships between data
4. Develop a usable solution to gain insight by analyzing biomechanical data employing data science approaches
