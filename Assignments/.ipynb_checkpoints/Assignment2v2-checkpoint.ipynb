    "Description: This assignment will assess your ability to use loops and functions to solve programming challenges. Some of the points will also requiere to use list/dictionaries to succesfully complete the task. Finally, the last point will help you to practice the concepts related to object oriented programming and developing simple user interfaces. \n",

    "1. [2 points] Write a function with one input, the input should be a string variable. Words in the string variable are separated by ```' '```. Your function should count:\n",
    "- The number of words in the sentence\n",
    "- The number of characters in the sentence (without including ```' '```)\n",
    "- The number of instances that every letter of the alphabet appears in the sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [2 points] Write a function with one input, the input should be a string variable. Words in the string variable are separated by ```' '```. Your function should identify if there are numbers in the sentence. If there are numbers, then the function must return the sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "- Input: 'There are 3 friends with me, 2 of us are older than 18'\n",
    "- Output: 23\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Input: 'My online friend, XX_SAM2000_XX is turning 18 next week'\n",
    "- Output: 2018\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. [2 points] Write a function with one input, the input should be a string representing a date using the following format: month (two digits)/ day (two digits) / year (four digits). The function should ensure that the inputs are valid, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "- 01/20/1985 -> valid input\n",
    "- 02/30/2022 -> not valid input (month 02 only has 28 or 29 days)\n",
    "- 15/12/2000 -> not valid input (month 15 is not valid)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your function should return the number of days since the provided date until today.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hints:\n",
    "    - You can find today's date using the following code:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from datetime import date\n",
    "    today = date.today().strftime(\"%m/%d/%y\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - A leap year is a year that is divisible by four. \n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    BMI =703*(weight)*(height**2) \n",
    "    ```\n",

    "\n",
    "    weigth should be provided in pounds and height in inches. \n",
